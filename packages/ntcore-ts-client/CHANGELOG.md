## 3.1.0

## 3.0.0-beta.1

### Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE: Remove immediateNotify from subscribe**
  - This complicated prefix topics and was not a very valuable feature
  - Workaround: you can manually call the subscription's callback yourself after subscribing

### Changes

- Add prefix topic support
  - You can now subscribe to multiple topics with a single subscription
  - This is done by creating a topic with a prefix, and then subscribing to that topic
  - For example, if you have topics `/MyTable/Accelerometer/X`, `/MyTable/Accelerometer/Y`, and `/MyTable/Accelerometer/Z`, you can create a prefix topic `/MyTable/Accelerometer/` and subscribe to that to get notifications for all three subtopics

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE: Drop support for v4.0**
  - The API now requires NT v4.1 to function
- **BRAKING CHANGE: publish and setProperties are now asynchronous**
  - Please await these calls to know when the changes take effect
    - After awaiting publish, it is safe to set new values to the topic

### Changes

- Add support for v4.1
  - No support for PING/PONG messages - Node/JS limitation
